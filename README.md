Moving Object Detection on a Stable Camera
This project implements moving object detection using OpenCV and video processing techniques. It is designed for stable (non-moving) cameras, making it suitable for surveillance, motion tracking, and activity monitoring.

Features:
Background subtraction to identify moving objects
Frame differencing to detect changes between consecutive frames
Contour detection to highlight objects in motion
Adaptive thresholding for robust detection in different lighting conditions
Configurable parameters for sensitivity and noise reduction
Technologies Used:

Python
OpenCV


How It Works:
The system captures frames from a video feed or recorded footage.
It applies background subtraction or frame differencing to detect movement.
Identified objects are processed using contours and bounding boxes.
The system can be fine-tuned for different environments and noise levels.
Usage:
Security monitoring
Traffic analysis
Wildlife observation
Industrial automation

Installation:

pip install opencv-python
